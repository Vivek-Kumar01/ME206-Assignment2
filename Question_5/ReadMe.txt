This sub folder contains:
1. the Adams simulation file (Q5_Adams.bin) made for the scenario in question 5
2. the plot for distance R between planes A and B and its two consecutive derivates (R dot and R double dot), similarly for the angle phi (phi, phi dot and phi double dot) that is the angle that position vector of A with respect to B makes with the plane (in my simulation its XY plane).

Here h = 2km, r = 5km and u = 1000km/hr

(While running the simulation, an extra bracket in the time makes the error, kindly remove it before running)
